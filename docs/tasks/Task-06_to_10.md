# Task 06–10 Report

Scope: Implement packaging and CI per docs/guides/codex-guide.md for the two‑tab FormGen app. Add PyInstaller spec, GitHub Actions build/release, and tagging instructions.

## What I Did
- Added `app.spec` exactly as shown in the guide.
- Added `.github/workflows/build-release.yml` implementing a 2‑OS matrix (Windows/macOS):
  - Builds with `pyinstaller --clean -y app.spec`.
  - Packages Windows build via PowerShell `Compress-Archive` to `dist/FormGen-windows.zip`.
  - Packages macOS build via `hdiutil` to `dist/FormGen-macos.dmg`.
  - Uploads both as artifacts and attaches to a GitHub Release.
- Prepared release tagging instructions and verification steps.

## How It Works
- `app.spec` includes necessary `datas` entries so UI, schema, and templates are bundled:
  - `ui/index.html`, `ui/static`, `ui/js`, `forms/schema.json`, `templates/`.
- Workflow triggers on `push` of tags matching `v*`.
- Matrix runs on `windows-latest` and `macos-latest` with Python `3.11`.
- Release job downloads artifacts and publishes a GitHub Release using `softprops/action-gh-release`.

## How To Trigger
1) Commit and push main changes.
2) Create and push the tag (annotated recommended):
```
# from repo root
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "v0.1.0"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

## Expected Outputs
- Windows artifact: `dist/FormGen-windows.zip`
- macOS artifact: `dist/FormGen-macos.dmg`
- Both attached to the GitHub Release for `v0.1.0`.

## Verification
- Local structure and paths validated against the guide.
- CI verification will occur on tag push. Confirm in the Actions tab:
  - Two successful matrix builds (Windows, macOS).
  - Release job completes and includes both artifacts.

## Mitigations / Notes
- If Release upload fails due to permissions, re-run the `release` job or manually attach artifacts.
- If assets are missing inside the packaged app, ensure `datas` in `app.spec` contains the required paths (`ui/*`, `forms/schema.json`, `templates/`).
- Windows blank window: install WebView2 Evergreen runtime (see README note).

## TODO(Owner)
- Push tag `v0.1.0` to trigger CI in the hosted repo.
- Confirm artifacts on the Release and smoke‑test the `.exe` and `.dmg` from the release page.
